"""Frozen CLIP text tower, faithful to CLIP-ReID's TextEncoder
(../CLIP-ReID/model/make_model_clipreid.py, lines 31-48) -- only the text-side transformer,
positional_embedding, ln_final, text_projection and token_embedding are kept. CLIP's own visual
encoder is never loaded/used anywhere in this pipeline: BPBreID's backbone is the sole visual
encoder (pcr/models/bpbreid_encoder.py), CLIP contributes only a frozen semantic anchor via text.

Loaded via the official openai/CLIP package (`pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git`,
done in pcr2-run), not CLIP-ReID's own vendored fork under CLIP-ReID/model/clip/ -- that fork is
patched specifically for CLIP-ReID's own ReID visual-encoder resolution/stride interpolation,
irrelevant here since the visual tower is never built.

RN50 is the default arch: its text embedding dim (`embed_dim`, the output of `text_projection` --
what actually gets compared against BPBreID's part embeddings in the alignment losses) is 1024,
exactly matching BPBReIDModelCfg.dim_reduce_output -- no projection layer needed between BPBreID's
part embeddings and CLIP's text embeddings there. Any other CLIP arch works too as long as its own
`embed_dim` is set to match on both sides -- ViT-B/32 and ViT-B/16 are 512, ViT-L/14 and RN50x16 are
768, RN50x4 is 640, RN101 is 512, RN50x64 is 1024 (same as RN50) -- none of the standard archs
produce 2048, so there is no way to reach that size through clip_arch choice alone.

`embed_dim` is NOT the same number as this transformer's own internal width (`transformer_width`,
exposed separately below) -- a real bug this repo hit switching from ViT-B/16 to RN50: ViT-B/16
happens to have `transformer_width == embed_dim` (both 512), which hid the distinction completely;
RN50's are different (512 internal, 1024 final, per `third_party/clip/model.py`'s own `CLIP.
__init__`: `transformer_width` sizes `token_embedding`/`positional_embedding`/the transformer
itself, while `text_projection` is a separate `[transformer_width, embed_dim]` matrix applied only
once, after the transformer, to reach the final joint embedding space). `PromptLearner`'s own
learnable context tokens get concatenated with this class's frozen `token_prefix`/`token_suffix`
(built from `token_embedding`, i.e. `transformer_width`-sized) *before* they ever reach this
class's `forward()` -- so they must be sized to `transformer_width`, not `embed_dim`, or that
concatenation fails outright (see PromptLearner's own docstring for the fix; progress.md has the
full story of finding this).
