"""BNNeck (Luo et al., "Bag of Tricks and a Strong Baseline for Deep Person Re-identification",
CVPRW 2019) -- one BatchNorm1d per branch, inserted between the pooled feature (combined, built in
examples/train_relational_finetune.py::compute_losses from BPBreIDEncoder's global embedding +
VisualAttentionBlock's mixed part embeddings) and whichever loss needs a differently-shaped
version of it.

The problem this solves: without it, Stage 2's triplet loss and its ID/align losses all read the
exact same feature vector, but want it shaped two different, competing ways -- triplet's Euclidean-
margin objective wants features spread out across the embedding space, while ID/align's softmax-
style classification converges better on a more compact, roughly-hyperspherical distribution.
Training one shared feature to satisfy both at once means each loss's gradient partially fights the
other's, every step. The fix: triplet loss keeps reading the feature BEFORE this BN layer
(unchanged -- see compute_losses, which still passes `combined` itself to PartTripletLoss); id/align
loss reads the feature AFTER it. Each loss gets the shape it actually wants, from the exact same
underlying pooled feature, via one extra learnable (but tiny -- 2 x embed_dim scale/shift
parameters per branch) affine transform in between.

Bias disabled on every BatchNorm1d (`bn.bias.requires_grad_(False)`) -- the original BoT paper's
own convention: a following linear classifier already has its own bias-like degree of freedom, so
a learnable BN shift is redundant with it, and BoT's own ablation found leaving it fixed at zero
(pure learned scale, no shift) works better in practice. `PartIdClassifiers`'s own linear layer is
left untouched (still has its own bias) -- that's a separate, additional detail from BoT's full
recipe, not needed for the specific triplet-vs-id/align interference this module fixes.

Scope note: BoT's own paper also recommends using the *post*-BN feature for retrieval at test time
(not just at training time), since the BN-normalized space is empirically more discriminative for
retrieval too. This repo's Evaluator (pcr/evaluators.py) doesn't apply VisualAttentionBlock at test
time at all yet, a separate, pre-existing gap -- wiring BNNeck into evaluation would need that fixed
first, and is out of scope here; this module only closes the specific gradient-interference gap
described above, at training time.
