    """n_ctx serves two purposes that CLIP-ReID's original code keeps as two separately-named
    variables (n_ctx, n_cls_ctx) always set to the same literal 4: the number of "X" placeholder
    tokens in the fixed template, and the length of the learnable context spliced into their
    place. One name here instead of two, since they must always be equal for the splicing to
    line up. The frozen prefix's own real length ("SOT + 'a photo of a'") is measured separately
    below, independent of n_ctx -- it used to be assumed equal to n_ctx+1, which only happened to
    hold at n_ctx=4 (that phrase's own real token count) and silently corrupted the prompt at any
    other n_ctx (verified: the first n_ctx-4 "X" placeholder embeddings got treated as frozen
    prefix instead of learnable context).

    One learnable context tensor, `ctx` ([num_identities, num_branches*n_ctx, ctx_dim]), flat so
    TextualAttentionBlock can attend across all M=1+K branches at once (branch 0 = global/
    foreground, 1..K = parts) -- a transformer layer needs its input as one sequence, not M
    separate blocks.

    Deviation from CLIP-ReID's original, found by actually running the training loop (back when
    this repo still only had UDA/USL, long before this file existed): CLIP-ReID creates its
    context directly in clip_model.dtype (fp16 on GPU). `torch.amp.GradScaler.step()` hard-errors
    ("Attempting to unscale FP16 gradients") on an fp16 leaf parameter -- mixed-precision
    training requires fp32 master weights. Fixed here: `ctx` is fp32 always, cast to the frozen
    buffers' dtype only inside build_part_prompts() when assembling each prompt -- autograd
    handles the cast's backward correctly (the incoming gradient is cast back to fp32 for
    accumulation into the fp32 parameter).
