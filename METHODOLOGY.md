# Methodology: Part-Aware, Semantically-Regularized Person Re-Identification

Last reset: 2026-08-29. This document describes the training pipeline as it actually exists in
this repo today, stage by stage. It replaces a previous version that had drifted from the code in
several places (stale loss temperature, a removed upstream filtering step, an incomplete Stage 1
negative-pool description, and a wrong foreground loss term) — everything below was checked
directly against the current code, not carried over from the old draft.

Three techniques are combined: **BPBreID** (WACV 2023) for part-attention pooling and visibility
scoring, **CLIP-ReID** (AAAI 2023) for CLIP-text-anchored prompt learning (generalized here to
per-body-part prompts), and **SPCL** (NeurIPS 2020) for self-paced unsupervised domain adaptation.

## 1. Notation

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $I$ | an input person image |
| $F$ | the backbone's spatial feature map, $\mathbb{R}^{H\times W\times C}$ |
| $K$ | number of body parts (5 in every config in this repo) |
| $M = 1+K$ | number of branches: index 0 is foreground/global, 1..K are the parts |
| $A_m$ | branch $m$'s spatial attention map (softmax over pixel-classifier logits) |
| $f_m$ | branch $m$'s pooled embedding, $\mathbb{R}^D$ |
| $v_m$ | branch $m$'s visibility score, continuous in Stage 0/1/2, in $[0,1]$ |
| $y_i$ | identity label of image $i$ |
| $\tau$ | a softmax temperature (each loss below states its own) |

## 2. Stage 0 — BPA Segmentation Pretraining

`examples/train_bpa_segmentation.py`. Trains BPBreID's pixel-to-part classifier as a plain
supervised segmentation task against PifPaf/MaskRCNN-derived ground-truth part masks
(`BodyPartAttentionLoss`, cross-entropy per pixel), before any CLIP/prompt machinery exists. This
is the only signal in the whole pipeline that ties branch index $m$ to a specific real anatomical
region — Stage 1's prompts use placeholder context tokens (no body-part words), and Stage 2/3's
id/triplet/align gradients have no notion of "this pixel is a knee." Runs only on Market1501
(DukeMTMC-reID has no masks on disk). Output: a plain BPBreID checkpoint, loadable as
`model.checkpoint_path` by every later stage.

## 3. Part-Based Visual Encoder

`pcr/models/bpbreid_encoder.py`, wrapping BPBreID (`third_party/torchreid`).

1. **Backbone** produces $F \in \mathbb{R}^{H\times W\times C}$ (HRNet32 or ResNet50).
2. **Pixel classifier (BPAM)** is a $1\times1$ conv over $F$ producing $M$ logit channels,
   softmaxed into attention maps $A_0 \ldots A_K$ (branch 0 = background).
3. **GWAP** (gated weighted average pooling) pools $F$ once per branch, weighted by that branch's
   own attention map: $f_m = \text{pool}(A_m \odot F)$. This is the only place $F$ and the
   attention maps are combined — the encoder's own input is just the raw image; $F$ and
   $A_0\ldots A_K$ are both produced internally, one from the other, not supplied externally.
4. **Visibility** $v_m$ is each map's peak confidence, $\max_{h,w} A_m[h,w]$ — continuous in every
   stage in this repo (the binary/argmax mode BPBreID also supports is never used here).

Every branch's embedding is L2-normalized independently before leaving the encoder.

## 4. Stage 1 — Per-Part Prompt Learning

`examples/train_relational_prompts.py`, config `configs/stage1_relational_prompts.yaml`. The
backbone/BPAM (from Stage 0) and CLIP's text encoder are both frozen; only a per-identity prompt
context and two small attention blocks train.

**Prompt construction** (`pcr/models/prompt_learner.py`). Each identity owns two learnable context
tensors: `fg_ctx` (foreground, never trained — Algorithm 1 has no foreground loss term, see below)
and `part_ctx` (all $K$ parts, laid out as one flat sequence so they can attend to each other).
Both splice into the fixed template `"A photo of a [ctx] person."` before the frozen CLIP text
encoder ever sees them.

**TextualAttentionBlock (TAB)** (`pcr/models/relation_blocks.py`) mixes `part_ctx`'s $K$ blocks via
self-attention before any part's prompt is assembled, so one part's context can be informed by the
others. It has no per-image signal to work with (`part_ctx` is indexed by identity alone), so it
uses each identity's *mean* per-part visibility across every cached training image of that
identity (`compute_identity_visibility`) as a soft attention-score bias — an unreliable part
contributes less as a key to every other part's post-attention representation. This table is saved
(`identity_visibility.pth`) and reused unchanged by `cache_text_anchors.py`, so TAB's output stays
a deterministic function of identity alone everywhere it's used.

**VisualAttentionBlock (VAB)**, the image-side counterpart, uses the same attention-bias mechanism
but with each image's own real per-part visibility (available fresh every forward call). A
zero-init tanh-gated residual keeps it a no-op at initialization; VAB is the one Stage 1 module
that survives into Stage 2.

**Loss — SupConLoss** (`pcr/loss/clip_supcon_loss.py`), CLIP-ReID's actual multi-positive
contrastive loss, not plain InfoNCE (PK-sampled batches put several images of the same identity in
one batch on purpose; SupCon's positive mask already handles that, InfoNCE would need a
deduplication patch that throws away all but one photo's gradient). Both i2t and t2i directions are
computed per part $k$, with $\tau = 0.1$:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{SupCon}} = -\sum_{i} \frac{v_i}{\sum_j v_j} \cdot \frac{1}{|P(i)|}\sum_{p \in P(i)} \log \frac{\exp(z_i \cdot z_p / \tau)}{\sum_{a} \exp(z_i \cdot z_a / \tau)}$$

where $P(i)$ is every same-identity row on the other side, and each anchor is weighted by its own
visibility ($v_i$, detached, floored at $10^{-3}$). $\tau=0.1$ (not SupCon's original $1.0$) because
of the next point:

**Full-identity-table negative pool.** Both directions compare against the *entire* training set,
not just the current PK batch (751 identities / 12936 images on Market1501) — matching CLIP-ReID's
own original design. i2t achieves this by splicing each batch's fresh, differentiable text row
together with a once-per-epoch snapshot of every *other* identity's text embedding
(`build_text_snapshot`, rebuilt under `no_grad` at the start of each epoch against that epoch's
current TAB/`part_ctx` weights). t2i simply compares against the whole cached feature set directly,
since the backbone is frozen and `cached_features` never goes stale. $\tau=1.0$ (SupCon's original
value) produced a near-random-guess loss for the first two epochs at this scale; $\tau=0.1$ clears
that floor markedly faster.

**No foreground loss term.** Only $k=1..K$ contribute to the loss sum — Algorithm 1 extracts
BPAM's global/foreground feature but never uses it in a loss. `fg_ctx` is therefore excluded from
the optimizer entirely and stays at its random initialization after Stage 1.

**No upstream visibility filter.** Every cached image trains, unconditionally — the old
image-level filter (`pcr/utils/visibility_filter.py`, deleted) discarded 61% of Market1501's
training images and was found to be driven by an undertrained BPAM signal rather than genuine
occlusion. Reliability is handled entirely by the two mechanisms above: attention-level masking
(VAB/TAB) and loss-level per-row weighting (SupCon's `weights`).

**Outputs**: `prompt_learner.pth`, `vab.pth`, `identity_visibility.pth` — consumed by
`examples/cache_text_anchors.py`, which builds two frozen, per-identity lookup tables for Stage 2:

- `text_prototypes.pth`: `[num_identities, M, D]`, each identity's per-branch pooled text embedding
  (unnormalized branch 0 included, but never read downstream — see Stage 2).
- `text_self_attention.pth`: `[num_identities, M, M]`, each identity's own CLIP text-transformer
  self-attention among those $M$ branch embeddings (see Stage 2 / CAB, below) — computed by
  replaying the text transformer's last block with `need_weights=True` (third_party/clip hardcodes
  it off) on this short $M$-token sequence. Only valid when the CLIP arch's `transformer_width`
  equals its `embed_dim` (true for ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/32, the two archs this repo actually uses —
  see `pcr/models/clip_text_encoder.py`'s own docstring on why those differ for the RN* archs).

Both tables are deterministic functions of identity alone (`prompt_learner`/TAB/the text encoder
are fully frozen once Stage 1 ends), which is exactly why they're computed once here rather than
recomputed inside Stage 2's training loop.

## 5. Stage 2 — Supervised Backbone Fine-Tuning

`examples/train_relational_finetune.py`, config `configs/stage2_relational_finetune.yaml`. The
backbone + BPAM unfreeze here (initialized from the *same* Stage 0 checkpoint Stage 1 used going
in); VAB continues training from its Stage 1 weights. Stage 1's prompt learner and the CLIP text
encoder are never loaded — only the two frozen tables they produced.

Per iteration: `combined = [f_0, \text{VAB}(f_1..f_K, v_1..v_K)]`, one `[B, M, D]` tensor.

**CrossAttentionBlock (CAB)**, new in this design (`pcr/models/relation_blocks.py`). Stage 1's
frozen text anchors describe BPAM's part definitions *as they were at the end of Stage 1* — but
Stage 2 keeps training BPAM further via id/triplet gradients that know nothing about real part
boundaries, so by late Stage 2 the anchors can describe a stale convention. CAB grounds the visual
branches against text every step instead of relying on a single static cosine-similarity pull:

$$\text{vis\_grounded}, A_{i2t} = \text{CAB}(\text{query}=\texttt{combined}, \text{context}=\texttt{prompt\_feats})$$

where `prompt_feats = text_prototypes[targets]` — no live CLIP forward pass needed, since that
table is already the exact per-branch embedding for this batch's real identities. CAB is a
standard multi-head cross-attention block with a zero-init tanh-gated residual (identity function
at init, same device as VAB's gate). `vis_grounded` (not raw `combined`) is what `L_align` reads
below. (A symmetric text-queries-image direction is deliberately not built — it would have no
consumer yet, so it isn't computed at all.)

**$\mathcal{L}_{\text{crossalign}}$** (`pcr/loss/cross_attn_align_loss.py`) keeps CAB's grounding
meaningful rather than an arbitrary learned reweighting: it's a row-wise KL divergence pulling
CAB's own image-queries-text attention pattern $A_{i2t}$ toward CLIP's real internal text
self-attention pattern for that identity (`text_self_attention[targets]`, precomputed in Stage 1 —
see above). Ramped in on a schedule, not from epoch 0, since CAB starts as a no-op (gate$=0$) and
benefits from a few epochs of plain $\mathcal{L}_{\text{align}}$ pressure first:

$$\lambda_{\text{crossalign}}(e) = \begin{cases} 0 & e < 0.25E \\ \lambda_{\max}\cdot\frac{e - 0.25E}{0.15E} & 0.25E \le e < 0.40E \\ \lambda_{\max} & e \ge 0.40E\end{cases}$$

($E$ = total epochs, $\lambda_{\max}=0.3$ by default). Verified directly: during the warmup phase
CAB's gate stays at exactly 0 (no gradient reaches it, since $\lambda_{\text{crossalign}}=0$ and
$\mathcal{L}_{\text{align}}$'s gradient through a gate of exactly 0 vanishes too), then starts
moving the moment the schedule activates.

**The other four loss terms**, matching Algorithm 2's own step 16 (all weights configurable, all
default to an implicit weight of 1 except where noted):

- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{id\_global}}$ — cross-entropy on the global (branch 0) classifier, post-BNNeck.
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{tri\_global}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{tri\_parts}}$ — batch-hard triplet, computed
  once on branch 0 alone and once per part branch (summed) — not one fused multi-branch call.
  Visibility gates triplet with a loose boolean floor (`triplet_visibility_min`, default 0.05) since
  batch-hard mining's max/min doesn't compose with continuous weights the way the others do.
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{align}}$ (`pcr/loss/clip_cosine_align_loss.py`) — softmax classification of
  each part's `vis_grounded` feature against that branch's full frozen prototype table (every other
  identity is an implicit negative), weighted per-part by continuous visibility. Parts only
  (branches 1..K) — `fg_ctx` was never trained in Stage 1, so `text_prototypes[:,0,:]` is
  meaningless and is never read.
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{attn}}$ (`BodyPartAttentionLoss`, same pixel-supervision loss as Stage 0) —
  mandatory whenever masks are configured, so BPAM can't drift arbitrarily far from Stage 0/1's
  anatomical convention while everything else keeps training it. Its weight now cosine-decays
  (`bpa_weight_initial → bpa_weight_floor` over `bpa_weight_decay_epochs`) rather than staying flat,
  so this constraint loosens gradually instead of applying uniform pressure for the whole run.

**BoT additions** (Luo et al., CVPRW 2019), not in Algorithm 2's own literal steps: BNNeck (one
BatchNorm1d per branch between the pooled feature and whichever of id/align reads it — triplet
keeps reading the pre-BN feature) and a 10-epoch linear LR warmup before the just-unfrozen backbone
and its newly-interacting losses hit full LR.

## 6. Stage 3 — Self-Paced Unsupervised Domain Adaptation

`examples/train_uda.py` / `examples/train_usl.py`, via `pcr/trainers.py`. Optional final stage:
adapts a Stage-2-finetuned model to an unlabeled target domain (UDA) or refines it with no labels
at all (USL). Confirmed present in the current code: DSBN (`pcr/models/dsbn.py`, domain-specific
BatchNorm so source and target statistics don't interfere), a part-aware hybrid memory
(`pcr/models/hm.py::PartHybridMemory`), DBSCAN clustering with Jaccard-distance re-ranking
(`pcr/utils/jaccard_rerank.py`) to generate pseudo-labels each epoch, and self-paced sample
reliability weighting so noisy pseudo-labels count for less. This stage is untouched by the CAB
work above — it loads a Stage 2 checkpoint's `state_dict` only, and never touches VAB/CAB/the text
side at all.

## 7. Fusion Module

`pcr/models/fusion_head.py::FusionHead` — combines the global and part embeddings into one
inference-time descriptor (fixed-weight or learned-gate). **Currently dormant**: it exists and is
unit-testable on its own, but has zero call sites anywhere in the training or evaluation scripts.
Wiring it in is a separate, unscoped piece of future work.

## 8. Evaluation Protocol

`pcr/evaluators.py::Evaluator` — standard person-ReID retrieval evaluation (mAP, CMC/Rank-k) run
periodically during Stage 2/3 and once at the end against the best checkpoint.
