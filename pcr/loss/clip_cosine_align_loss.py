"""Classification-style rewrite of Stage 2's alignment term, replacing the earlier pure-regression
version (`1 - cosine_sim(relation_feats[:,k], frozen_text_anchors[label,k])`, no other identity's
anchor involved at all). Restores CLIP-ReID's own original mechanism -- a softmax classification
against the *entire* frozen prototype table, so every other identity's anchor acts as an implicit
negative -- while keeping this repo's per-part visibility weighting on top. See changes.md's "Red
flag 4" and IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md section 3 for the full rationale: a loss with no repulsion term at
all can be minimized by letting every identity's features drift toward each other, which is exactly
backwards for re-identification.

Per-sample `weights` (required, not optional -- same convention as pcr/loss/clip_supcon_loss.py's
SupConLoss): a branch with low visibility for a given sample contributes proportionally less to
that branch's own alignment term. Explicitly detached before use (`weights.detach()`) -- IMPROVEMENT_
PLAN.md section 1 / changes.md's "Red flag 1": examples/train_relational_finetune.py's own encoder
construction switches to continuous (differentiable) visibility scores, so without detaching here,
gradient descent has a standing incentive to lower a hard-to-align part's own visibility score
instead of actually improving its alignment -- a shortcut that reduces this loss without the
network doing the work the loss is meant to encourage. Weights are additionally floored
(`weight_floor`, default 1e-3) so no sample is ever exactly zero-weighted.
