"""Frozen CLIP visual tower (`clip_model.visual`), loaded and frozen per the Stage 1 algorithm's
own initialization step ("load pretrained CLIP image encoder... freeze"). Not consumed by Stage
1's forward pass -- BPBreID's backbone remains the sole visual encoder actually producing the
embeddings used in this pipeline's losses (see pcr/models/bpbreid_encoder.py and
pcr/models/clip_text_encoder.py's own docstring for why). This class exists so the algorithm's
initialization step is followed literally; `forward()` is provided for completeness/future use
(mirrors CLIP's own `encode_image`) but nothing in examples/train_relational_prompts.py currently
calls it.

Loaded independently from pcr/models/clip_text_encoder.py::ClipTextEncoder (a second `clip.load()`
call) rather than sharing one loaded model between the two -- keeps each class self-contained and
single-purpose, at the cost of loading CLIP's weights into memory twice. A one-time load cost, not
a per-iteration one, so left as the simpler design rather than plumbing a shared model instance
through two otherwise-independent classes.
